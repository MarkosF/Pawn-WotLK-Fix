## About

This is a fixed and backported version of the **Pawn** addon, designed for [Wrath of the Lich King Classic 3.3.5a](https://worldofwarcraft.com/).

The original Pawn is by [Travis Spomer](https://www.curseforge.com/members/travisspomer/projects)  
([CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn)).

This repo includes all necessary code tweaks and polyfills to ensure Pawn runs without errors on the 3.3.5a client.
